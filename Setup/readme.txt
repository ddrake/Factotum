To work correctly, Factotum needs to be installed for a single user profile on any given machine.  All actual users will need to log in to that same profile to use it.  If the profile provided for the primary user does not have permission to install applications, the system administrator installing the application should log in under the profile of the end user and execute the installer using "Run as Administrator" as explained below.

The following installation procedure is recommended:

-    Log in as the user who will be using the application.
-    Control Panel > Programs and Features:  Uninstall Factotum if it shows as installed
-    Download the zipfile for Factotum and extract to a temporary folder.
-    The folder will contain two files:
        setup.exe (size approx 400 KB)
        Setup.msi (size approx 5 MB)
-    Right-click setup.exe and select "Run as Administrator"
-    When prompted for the location to install the program, click 'browse' if necessary to ensure that the directory is valid:
        If the machine is 64 bit, the directory needs to be C:\Program Files (x86)\Factotum 1.22
        If the machine is 32 bit, the directory needs to be C:\Program Files\Factotum 1.22
-    Accept the license agreement.
-    Complete the installation.  Icons should be created on the desktop and in the start menu.  Also a folder called Factotum should be added to the user's desktop.

If you have any difficulty installing Factotum, please feel free to contact me.
